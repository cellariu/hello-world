My hello-world repository
Hello there,

I try to learn a bit about GitHub since I find great to have a cloud based repository to save my work. I'm comming a long way to Git, starting with MKS and continuing to CVS and then SVN. But it's fine. In this way, I can appreciate better Git and GitHub opportunities.
